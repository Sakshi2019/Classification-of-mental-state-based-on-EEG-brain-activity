# Classification-of-mental-state-based-on-EEG-brain-activity

In online education over open sources, it is difficult to obtain immediate feedback from the student. The EEG-signal headset is a sensor which detects students’ mental state and this is enough for online education platform to get feedback. Using data obtained from EEG signals of a student watching a video, we trained and tested a classifier to determine whether a student is confused or not. The performance of our classifier is above chance and comparable to human observers, who predicts on the basis of facial expressions, body language, etc.
This approach of detecting the mental state of students is very useful to provide tutor relevant information which leads to betterment of online education sources. 
AIM:
•	To train the classifier according to the feature vectors obtained from the dataset of EEG signals
•	To study and implement Gaussian Naive Bayes Algorithm and determine the accuracy of the trained model
•	To determine the mental state (confused/not confused) on the basis of obtained results
